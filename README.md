**This file belonged to some simple Kali tools that I was interested in and kept notes about when I started this job in 2018. Then, this year, I decided to put it in a separate repository and share it openly, and I made it a more beautiful notes page by making it with the .md extension.**

My hidden main repositories file is also in the picture above. It shows the date I first added

###### A small note: When I first created the version system, it was progressing in the style of v1.0 - v1.1, so it is the second file I saved to github, so it is valuable to me.
